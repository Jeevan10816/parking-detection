# How to prepare the dataset

## Download the dataset

- Navigate to this [site](https://public.roboflow.com/object-detection/pklot/1/download/coco)
- Select 'Download zip to computer' and click Continue
- Extract the contents from the .zip file.
- Move 'valid', 'test', and 'train' folders to the location 'test_code/data/PKLot/'.

## Run code

- Run preprocessing.py
- Run modeling.py
- Run integration.py

## Notes

- I tried to do my best so that the paths to files where generic so anyone could run. If something is off, let me know.
